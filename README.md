# Thesis
Repository for all files used during my Thesis research. This github repo has two purposes: first off, it acts as an extra appendix to my thesis and can be viewed by anyone who ready my thesis and wants to take a deeper dive into the technical aspects. Secondly, these files are publicly available for anybody and are free to use and alter. 

The repository contains a file and a folder. The file is a snapshot of the first 100 records of the sensor log used during my research.
In the folder, 5 different subfolders can be found, each containing a Python script. These scripts were made during my research, and all have a different purpose. Each one is designed to inject some sort of Data Quality Issue, based on a predefined chance. The scripts contain comments about how the code works.
